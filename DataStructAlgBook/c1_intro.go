____ Notes ____

Algorithm: finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning
           and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finte length
           of time.

Imperitive programming: describes computation in terms of instructions that
           change the program/data state.

Declerative Programming: specifies what the program should accomplish
            without describing how to do it.

Given an algorithm, we ask:
  1. Specification: what is it supposed to do?
  2. Verification: does it really do what it is supposed to?
  3. How efficient does it do it?

Data Structures: particular way of organizing data for a particular operation.
